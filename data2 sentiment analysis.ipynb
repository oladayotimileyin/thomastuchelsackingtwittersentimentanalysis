      "\n",
      "15 )    We are not acting as if Tuchel will get us Top 4. The point here is that this Board are giving room to lack ambition, they need to let him know UCL is priority even though they won't sack him if he don't get it.\n",
      "Why bringing out this news to the media the standard is falling 😭\n",
      "\n",
      "16 )  I really don't mind it, was the same with Lampard and especially Tuchel. Think there should always be minimum expectations they should meet in their first seasons but to sack a manager after 1 for lets say finishing 5th is mental.\n",
      "\n",
      "17 )    Look man the way things were going even if Roman was still here Tuchel could have gotten the sack, was it to early for sure but no improvement from pre season to the match in Zagreb our defense is easy to break and opposition defense don’t stress themselves\n",

      "23 )   But gave Tuchel an instant sack despite being 5 points off the 1st position , it's clear Boehly only sacked Tuchel because he didn't like him . He didn't care about what Tuchel did for the clubs and how the fans loved him , the only thing he listened to was his damned self\n",

      "\n",
      "28 )  You all can go ahead and get behind him, you can’t make me fall in love with Tuchel and just sack him like that. 😢\n",
      "\n",
      "29 ) __ Don't forget Dortmund 😂, Boehly was prepared to take the heat and model Chelsea to his liking. I think he didn't want to sack Tuchel immediately as that would have been even worse, so he had to wait for a perfect chance to pounce on\n",
      "\n",
      "30 )  It was too early  for the CHELSEA management to sack Coach Thomas Tuchel .\n",
      "\n",
      "31 )  Early  factually baseless conclusion.Not wise to count your chickens before they hatch. Nothing done so far suggest savings or strategic value in the decision taken to sack Tuchel. Would be more appropriate to do the first value appraisal at the end of May 2023. Early days.\n",
      "\n",
      "32 )  There’s no justifiable explanation for the timing of his sacking Victor. I had good hopes because of the owners ambition during the summer transfer window. But the manner of Tuchel’s sack blindsided the supporters!\n",

      "36 )   Lol I know , just some weeks back we had news of Tuchel contract talks before the sack , so you just never know but we will see tho\n",
      "\n",
      "37 ) Tuchel sack was forthcoming right when he got involved in player signings, his clear rule was to let him do his job as a coach. Worth the long term benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "38 ) USMNT coach Greg Berhalter: \"I talked lots with Boehly over the past few weeks trying to convince him to sack Thomas Tuchel. I’m thrilled it finally happened and we can now see how good Christian Pulisic can be in the Premier League for Chelsea. I can’t wait.”\n",

      "41 )    Have you not read what’s come out or are you ignoring it. I loved Tuchel. My favourite Chelsea manager by far but the reasonings for the sack (which wasn’t based on results)is kinda fair enough\n",
      "\n",
      "42 )   I haven’t lied and that’s what hurts the most. It’s the truth, sadly. No one wanted it to turn out this way but it did. Tuchel deserved the sack just as much as Lampard did.\n",
      "\n",
      "43 ) This is no excuse, Tuchel came in and win the Champions league and qualified for Champions league same season. Why sack him if you expect less for the new manager you spent over £60 million \n",

      "44 )  Exactly if you’re going to sack a coach like Tuchel the guy you bring in needs to deliver the bare minimum\n",

      "\n",
      "46 ) Unfortunately a change of manager was needed otherwise we’d be looking at 15/16 all over again. At the end of the day if you could sack the entire squad then that would be more ideal considering the stuff that’s been circulating about certain individuals cfc chelsea Tuchel\n",

      "\n",
      "In a very hostile manner he was sent away which hurt many fans.\n",
      "\n",
      "56 )  For those saying Tuchel wasn't sacked because of results, this excuse would have been tenable had Boehly ever had the guts to sack him if we were top of the league. \n",
      "Would Boehly have discarded Tuchel if Chelsea had won all their matches (EPL  UCL)?\n",

      "\n",
      "60 ) one thing I’m very sure  is Todd was not willing to part way with pulisic but Tuchel want him gone,it’s also part for Tuchle sack. \n",
      "\n",
      "61 )   Tuchel lost the dressing room already and I saw the sack coming just that it was too early and the Owner make Thier ambition clearer from the start ,I don't care who is on board all I care about is success\n",
      "\n",
      "62 )  Juve clear, they gonna sack allegri any day now, I don’t think tuchel will join Liverpool either\n",
      "\n",
      "63 ) It’s funny how every time a manger is sack at Chelsea it’s the players fault like peoples knowledge about tactics is embarrassing tbh like tuchel how attack strategy was basically cross and vibes\n",
      "\n",
      "64 )   Skye listen idk if u aren't reading my replies but i do not disagree with u! I can analyze a situation and see his sack would hv come eventually. But i've said it numerous times i do not like Boehly's attitude and treatment of Tuchel in the end, very snake like\n",

      "65 )  Lol enough of all these already. Tuchel could've been sacked right after Leeds or even before if Roman was here.\n",
      "Roman sacked Jose and so many other top coaches we've had  we came out on top. Sack of Thomas isn't the end of Chelsea. We'll win  grow so much more going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "66 )  _   I really don’t wanna argue with you. But sacking tuchel wouldn’t solver anything. The new coach will definitely face the shit TT faced! They’ll have to sack him also till when? I’m sure as hell Abrahamovich wouldn’t have sacked TT. It’s way too soon for someone that gave is all\n",
      "\n",
      "67 )  Lovely but why did he sack tuchel 😔\n",
      "\n",
      "68 )  lmaoo same too,they can't compete anymore they don't play good football,if they're smart they'll sack simeone and hire tuchel,Diego has done enough its time to move on\n",
      "\n",
      "69 )  i’m saying tuchel did a good job with chelsea and accomplished a lot but putting that stat makes it seem like the sack was reasonable\n",
      "\n",
      "70 ) Am saying its a kind of something else as chelsea sack thomas tuchel,we hope chelsea not gonna relent without him\n",
      "\n",
      "71 ) _  The media part is the most funniest part because many news broke out after the sack, my question to the media is that “they report of this toxic relationship with Tuchel and Owner” why haven’t they report this before ?\n",
      "\n",
      "72 )   If we can't afford to sack Rodgers we can't afford to hire Tuchel lol\n",
      "\n",
      "73 ) So  why did you sack Thomas Tuchel without explaining yourself to the fans, he didn't even have time to say goodbye to the players... At least he deserved better than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "74 )  I do believe he had his preference when he baught the club to have a new manager but obviously tuchel was so popular he couldn't just sack him so tried backing him the signings wernt bad for any manager to work with\n",
      "\n",
      "75 ) They set tuchel up. Pretty obvious. Hold it against him so they have excuses to sack him. Funny owners \n",
      "\n",
      "76 )  Makes sense when i heard its bcos Tuchel refused to have a 37 yr old in his twilight that d owner made decision in their mind to sack him, exactly what new rookie owners would want to do.. thankful for our owner who backed our manager under similar circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "77 ) The more I’ve thought about it, the only issue I have with Tuchel getting sacked is the timing. Why not just do it in the summer? Why let him choose 300 million worth of players only to sack him? I think him getting the sack eventually was inevitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "78 )   That's why I've always blamed our players for Tuchel's sack. Boehly would've never sacked him if our lazy players performed well each week  we we got convincing results...It's impossible to manage a team where you've fall out with most of players...\n",
      "\n",
      "79 )   Thése players hv acted like babies about this entire situation, u cannot blame Tuchel for their performances. Again i've said it various times i understand that he lost the dressing room and why it was best to sack him...my problem with Boehly goes beyond that👍\n",
      "\n",
      "80 ) Sack of Thomas Tuchel could be ‘positive’ for Christian Pulisic at Chelsea \n",
      "\n",
      "81 ) pleading for more time. And rather than going for a more experienced coach, Chelsea went for a coach that has no UCL experience  hasn't won a single trophy throughout his career and paid 22m pounds to Brighton to get him. There is more to Tuchel's sack than what is obvious.\n",
      "\n",
      "82 )  Tuchel's sack was untimely. Well,I wish Porter the new coach better achievements more than the previous ones\n",
      "\n",
      "83 ) Liverpool fit Sack Klopp and Thomas Tuchel na potential replacement     ~All football\n",

      "\n",
      "85 ) Because Tuchel had spent millions and he moans he needs more players when he’s got internationals worth 50 million on the bench to come on .Liverpool won’t sack Klopp\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "261 ) Tuchel isn’t looking great after the sack at   cfc \n",
      "\n",
      "262 )  Absolutely, if it were at the end of the season with time, then I would say yes. But Chelsea spent so much money for Tuchel only to sack him so fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "263 )  Yes now. They've been planning this for long. They just found  good excuse to sack Tuchel.\n",
      "\n",
      "264 ) i’m still surprised Tuchel got the sack tbh\n",
      "\n",
      "265 ) Do you think it was the right decision for Chelsea to sack Tuchel?\n",
      "\n",
      "266 ) Juvè would be smart to sack allegri and get Tuchel in asap. \n",

      "269 ) feel sorry for the brighton fans tbh, lost a really good manager to chelsea who left cause they decided to sack tuchel for no reason and now they are left with nothing, i know we took bdb off them but he’s a geordie lad so it was only fair for him to come home 🖤🤍\n",
      "\n",
      "270 ) 1. The reason for the sack can be condensed into a single word : Sustainability. Tuchel may be an elite tactician and a great coach who really identified and related with the club, but of he were at the helm for the long term, we could have gone into financial ruins.\n",
      "\n",
      "271 )    _ Tuchel is not the club. So not been emotional after Tuchel sack does not imply they don’t love the club.\n",

      "\n",
      "272 ) Last 25 games were close to Lampard except it was more goals conceded, less scored too. If Tuchel was improving players individually id be very against the sack more, but there was a huge noticeable dropoff. In the end he didn't change enough. Harsh and respect him but good move \n",

      "\n",
      "276 ) Most Chelsea fans their problem is not the sacking of Tuchel because over the years it’s normal to sack coaches at CFC I think the problem most fans have with the new Chelsea coach is that he is not an elite coach am very sure if it was zidan no one will be talking of Tuchel .\n",

      "Tuchel in?\n",
      "\n",
      "280 ) _ I have a feeling they recruited with him in mind cus Apparently they had planned to sack Tuchel for a while anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "281 ) This is one of the reason sacking Tuchel right now is brainless, if you want to sack him is better before the pre-season started or still in the transfer window. Its harsh and rush decision to be made by Boehly and the board \n",
      "\n",
      "282 )  The new owners are the ones who sack Tuchel. No?\n",
      "\n",
      "If they can sack a coach who won UCL a season ago just after backing him in the recently closed transfer window, I don't trust them. Lol\n",
      "\n",
      "283 )  The reason behind the Thomas tuchel sacking is Ronaldo tobby told him to sign Ronaldo he said aub is better, that's the reason he was sack.\n",
      "\n",
      "284 )  Tuchel said no to Ronaldo only to play trash football... Chelsea needed a goalscorer not defenders that can't defeat..  Todd Boehly did the right thing to sack that German fraud Tuchel.  Tuchel, Ralf Rangnick and Klopp are finished now..\n",
      "\n",
      "285 )  Exactly why the Tuchel firing is criticized every where , we literally sold Gilmour and signed Auba and Zackary coz of TT and then didnt let him work with them.  No warning simply sack\n",
      "\n",
      "286 ) Now Juve needs to sack Allegri and hire Tuchel. That man is too good to be jobless, whilst Allegri is too wank to be having a job lmao\n",
      "\n",
      "287 )  Going by what I read Tuchel getting the sack was because he didn't want c.ronaldo. weather that's true I don't know\n",
      "\n",
      "288 ) Make it make sense. How is this fair?\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is Todd Boehly  Co wanted a fresh start, Tuchel didn’t help himself, sure, but the facts are the new owners were looking for any excuse to sack him.\n",
      "\n",
      "289 ) Manchester United need to sack Erik Ten Hag for Tuchel to replace him if they want to win trophies again. Erik Ten Hag   won't win them trophies.\n",
      "\n",
      "290 )  Do you think it's a good decision to sack Tuchel? I'm actually waiting for your views since chelsea sacked the German.\n",
      "\n",
      "291 )       Then he deserves a sack for spending millions and millions and not having players he needs? An academy full of talent, open paycheck, and no one is right for Tuchel? Ha you lot are funny.\n",
      "\n",
      "292 ) Chelsea owner is a coward to sack tuchel over the phone without valid grounds cowardly toxic bf vibes. Walk of shame man tuchel deserves better ChelseaFC Tuchel\n",
      "\n",
      "293 ) @ Tuchel seemed to get a lot of backing in the window.I wasn't expecting him to be sacked this  looks like the decision was made to sack him a while ago considering how quick GP was appionted. They say GP will be given time. If they don't qualify for the CL?\n",

      "303 ) I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s a major reason Chelsea’s owners considered to sack tuchel \n",
      "\n",
      "304 ) _   Tuchel was getting sacked regardless, the owners obviously wanted there own man in but they couldn’t excactly sack TT straight away\n",
      "\n",
      "305 )  Nobody Dey tinnop sack coach anyhow. What Tuchel do? If you Dey want long term success, e be am. Short term, e be am. Any coach atm go be downgrade on Tuchel and rightly so. This only Dey show say dem get other issues. E no go fi be team performance\n",
      "\n",
      "306 ) Not at all to your last question. I feel pained about Tuchel sack,the manner,timing and the fact that he's one of us Blue all in all. I have picked up a beef with the  owners. Very disrespectful in all to Tuchel based on what he achieved and did for the club. \n",

      "310 )   We need to sack Klopp and get a totally new manager, one that offers a dynamic perspective. Not Tuchel. KloppOut\n",
      "\n",
      "311 ) Some people dey act like dem no sack coach make Tuchel come. Coaches go coaches come. That’s the nature of the job. Yes we are going to miss Tuchel but what options do we have on the market now? Be realistic kakra\n",
      "\n",
      "312 ) Still trying to put myself together, it has to be more than just performances that made them sack tuchel, something I think happened behind the scenes they are not telling us.\n",

      "313 ) I can’t wait to be reading how Chelsea players feel on Tuchel sack and their expectations from the new boss\n",

      "\n",
      "315 )   You didn’t say this with tuchel lol like dude shut up you just mad cause tuchel got sack I love tuchel but y’all acting like Chelsea is done maybe but rn let’s see\n",

      "\n",
      "323 )   they ready for the big time? Honestly, everything about this deal just screams DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN. First, the players may be aggrieved from Tuchel's sack and underperform. Secondly, how does he motivate the big boys in the dressing room, seeing his CV?\n",
      "\n",
      "324 )  He's a good coach, let just give him our support.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "327 )    The fans didn't sack Thomas Tuchel..the new owners did. What the fans think or do not think doesn't matter. They will keep sacking whether you win trophies or not...New era, same idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "328 ) Some fans acting like Chelsea didn’t sack Mourinho who is our greatest manager and Lampard who was our greatest player. Tuchel was loved and we are hurt about his sacking but Chelsea Football Club is and should be the most important.\n",

      "329 )  Sack allegri, sign tuchel  . Ur welcome\n",

      "\n",
      "332 ) I do think it was too soon to sack tuchel, but if we are being honest chelsea haven’t looked very good since midway through last season\n",
      "\n",
      "333 )  Honestly I’m still not happy about tuchel being sack, I think it could really bite the club in the ass, but at the same time I will give the new manager every chance it’s a big test going from Brighton to Chelsea so only time will tell I guess\n",
      "\n",
      "334 )  bunch of clowns lol: 40mln total deal to sack Tuchel who brought you the UcL. new money is laughable\n",
      "\n",
      "335 )  same. Tuchel is a fantastic manager that didn't deserve the sack.\n",
      "And Brighton was on really good form but now they could lose the momentum.\n",
      "\n",
      "336 )  I think you are correct. I saw Tuchel’s numbers after the sack and it’s still a shock to me. Well, Chelsea has never joked around with this kinda things. Quick success has always been their m.o. over experience and process.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "1435 )   The season is still young, and most of the teams are struggling to adjust because of the many signings each team made, Chelsea in particular. Am telling u, this Boehly guy is an amateur and needs to know when he can sack a manager. Roman would never have sacked tuchel tbh\n",

      "\n",
      "1441 )  They didn’t kick Tuchel out based on performance. Performance was a convenient excuse that’s why I think they are doing it now rather than wait cos he could turn around the situation and they won’t be able to sack him but they want him gone for their own project. Maybe long term\n",

      "\n",
      "1445 )  I don't like most of the decisions Tuchel took in the last 6 months.  But I think it's silly to trust his judgement to spend all that money and then sack him in the first week of september.\n",
      "\n",
      "1446 ) Tuchel did not deserve a sack to be honest. If this was in December okay but right now it’s just crazy\n",
      "\n",
      "1447 )    I’m with you, I hate that we can’t stay loyal to a manager that wants to be here. But somehow we manage to stay successful. So it’s hard as a chelsea fan to argue it. But spending £300 mill on a team tuchel wants, to then sack him is ridiculous\n",
      "\n",
      "1448 )   I want hear from tuchel himself cause this is bs. Giving a manager this much money and then deciding to sack him doesn’t sit right with me\n",

      "61 )  Ancelotti actually had a rough patch that season.Infact at a point he was 12 points behind Man united,but Abramovich didn't sack him till the end of that season where he finished 2nd. So it wasn't as painful as TT's.Tuchel deserved to be left at least till the end of the season.\n",
