4515,2022-09-07 14:51:26+00:00,MrGoph,Ted Boehly have no idea how Chelsea sacking coaches works. He should have waited until January then sack Tuchel. They would have strolled to another CL off the new coach vibe.
4516,2022-09-07 14:51:22+00:00,Wandei7,Boehly wanted Ronaldo due to his ability to wow and pull crowds and the ripple effect of the kit sales. Tuchel did not think that a good idea and ignored the offer. Eventually Boehly got tired of him and thus he waited for a reason to sack him. Last night he was served the reason

Then you actually get him players he want...and sack him 7 games in. The new coach just going to have the same issue

I'd say we are in good hands tbh but Tuchel's run hasn't been great in the league. Something had to give. We can't sack the players and Tuchel kept playing the ones that have been on poor form. Tuchel sacked himself imo.

15462,2022-09-07 03:33:29+00:00,Miracle70907511,@FabrizioRomano pls when is Thomas tuchel getting the sack. Because from the look of things I think he has run out of ideas to coach Chelsea football club.
15463,2022-09-07 03:28:29+00:00,Kingkarayu,@FrankKhalidUK Sack Tuchel
15464,2022-09-07 03:06:56+00:00,priyancep,My Only problem with Tuchel is giving minutes to Ziveych and Pulisic both are clearly not wanting to play for the club. If you asking for Tuchel to get sack do remember what he did and faced in last season as well as before.

I WANT to believe the Tuchel is the man for us long term. I just don't see it.

Since Todd won't sack him now, hope.he proves me wrong."

15478,2022-09-07 01:59:43+00:00,IAM_Aayam,Chelsea fans being overreactive again. Yes i am overreactive too. But thats my agression for the particular game. Not against the manager. How can you say we have to sack tuchel. The question for you is since when have we been a stable team?
15479,2022-09-07 01:52:34+00:00,cfcFrankieG,@CFCDaily @Garysonfire I'm backing Tuchel. But this is 100% correct. There is no getting around this. Results need to improve drastically...or he will be deserving of the sack

15481,2022-09-07 01:42:56+00:00,RealKiwiMamba,"We were regular challengers during Roman’s reign.  5 titles in 19 years is pretty damn good.  Transition? What transition.  Tuchel and Boehly just spent £300m and the team got worse.

If we can sack Jose after 3 leagues, and sack Di Matteo after our first UCL, we can sack Tuchel. https://t.co/VpZCQ2LAiF"
15482,2022-09-07 01:36:00+00:00,MmelsAltt,"@Adrussy_ I'll give up if this keeps on for a month or two more. Tuchel has shown over his tenure just how great a manager he is. Then if we sack him we'll bring someone who wins something in a year, gets bad then gets sacked again. And we're gonna keep complaining about the same things"

It’s the same pattern. Bohley trusts tuchel and won’t sack him yet. Individually they are better now than last year. Let tuchel get them firing as a team

15489,2022-09-07 00:54:46+00:00,TheRealMacATK,@OliviaBuzaglo Love Tuchel but it's normal to have questions about his tactics. The minute you spend 250+ million on players the excuses go out the window. It's sad that we're back to this carousel of thinking to sack managers but it's the only way to look at it with all that money spent

15492,2022-09-07 00:43:21+00:00,tyresekoby,There is no manager available to sack tuchel for imo. Zidane is the really only option There and to me he’s one of those coaches that builds a style of play based on the players he has. That does take too long and ion bout transitioning anymore this is a new era diff ownership.
15493,2022-09-07 00:33:27+00:00,syedjr_,@KingAdely Sack Tuchel. Hire Michael Feichtenbeiner.

You think if any of these players rated Tuchel they would have ditched? Werner himself said the fun was dead. He keeps playing players out of position. He doesn’t give minutes to his subs. He’s lost it. Sack him idgaf."
15495,2022-09-07 00:21:08+00:00,omariba_ke,"Full time thoughts.

• Sack Tuchel.

• Havertz is irredeemable.

• Mount is finished.

• Sterling is so wasteful.

• Ziyech deserves to be on the bench.

• Kepa is better than Mendy.

• Sack Tuchel.

• Koulibaly is awful.

• James is a beast. https://t.co/lXKJr665cY"
