09-07-2022,"_ I'll give up if this keeps on for a month or two more. Tuchel has shown over his tenure just how great a manager he is. Then if we sack him we'll bring someone who wins something in a year, gets bad then gets sacked again. And we're gonna keep complaining about the same things",0.44833333333333336,0.18000000000000005,Positive

09-07-2022,  If we sack tuchel thee players will play well for the next 9 months then they’ll dip in form and turn in the next manager. It’s the same pattern.
